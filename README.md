# How to use:
- Clone this repository.

- go to `http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin/cameras/camera/` and press `add camera` in the top right corner of the screen.
- fill in the form with a title (E.g. `Camera1`), the url of your camera (E.g. `http://192.168.0.11:8000/stream.mjpg`) and the name of the directory that the recordings for this camera are in (E.g. `camera1`). See the image below.
- Hit save and repeat the 2 steps above for every camera you want to add.
- In `ReplaySite/settings.py` change the value of `MEDIA_ROOT` to the path of the parent directory of the folder that the recordings for this camera are in (So here that would be the parent directory of `camera1`). See the image below. Make sure to use forwardslashes and not backslashes.
